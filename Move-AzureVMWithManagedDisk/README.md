# Move Azure VM with Managed Disk to another Resource Group
At the moment of writing this blog itâ€™s unfortunately not possible to move an Azure VM with Managed disk to another Resource Group or to another Description. However, Microsoft says on the Azure Portal that this will be possible in the near feature. For the time being, I have chosen to write a small PowerShell script that will do the move fully automated for you.
